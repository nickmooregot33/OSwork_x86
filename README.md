# OSwork_x86


This is where I play with developing an OS for x86.

1.	Trying to build a cross compiler.
	-failed with an attempt at gcc 5.1.0 using the osdev.org wiki tutorial
	-attempting with the LFS devel build, since it uses gcc 5.1.0
	-also attempting with cygwin build build versions

2.	build a kernel	(can't attempt until the cross compiler works)
